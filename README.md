# Notes about reed9999's exploratory fork
This is the source code to accompany a blog post [on time series analysis](https://towardsdatascience.com/time-series-analysis-in-python-an-introduction-70d5a5b1d52a). I don't know exactly what it will entail yet, but I'm publishing it to Github so readers can follow along with my investigation. The most interesting changes will probably be in additive_models. 

Only the new commits are my own work.

# Data-Analysis

Data Analysis Using Python and a little R. 

A place to share my code and reports for various data science projects.

Many of these projects are written up on my [Towards Data Science Medium page](https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen).
